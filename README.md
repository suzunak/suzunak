## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite applications and the features I like: 

Webtoon
  - The background music while reading (included in some chapters).
  - Automatic bookmark save.
    
Tiktok
  - The filters that anyone can create and share.
  - The automatic search suggestion in the comment section.
  - My tiktok algorithm suggestions.
    
Sticker Maker
  - Creating stickers by using my own photos.
  - Being able to export them to iMessage amd WhatsApp.
  - Downloadable stickers created by others.
    
I would like to create an application where people can use a single platform to see each other's availability.
Since it will be a management application aimed towards college students, I would like to implement reminders and links in the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  I was able to follow the instructions smoothly, so I decided to take on the challenge to add different features (e.g. changing the color of the fonts when the button is pressed).
  I am fairly new to coding and iOS Development, so I had a difficult time understanding how to implement the features using Swift.
  I am still unsure on how to change the font style when the button is pressed, so I hope to figure that out soon.
